Description:

  CIP is a small collection of mostly Perl scripts which
  faciliates the creation, launching and archival of small
  idealized and non-idealized COSMO model runs. CIP considers
  the two hosts: a frontend where the launching and post-
  processing is done, and a number cruncher where the actual
  COSMO model simulation is executed. All possible actions are
  done via one command (cip) which accepts several actions
  (clean, compile, diff, kill, new, post, restore, start).
  Help for all commands and possible options can be obtained
  by supplying the -h option.

Files:

 After having installed CIP you need to set the environment
 variable CIP_BASE to point to your installation directory.

 $CIP_BASE/bin/cip
   make a link to this file into your personal ~/bin directory
   or add $CIP_BASE/bin to your $PATH environment variable in
   or to be able to use CIP.

 $CIP_BASE/cip.conf
   Contains settings proper to your environment such as
   your user name and the host names.

 $CIP_BASE/skel/cip_globals
   Contains settings proper for each case. If not otherwise
   specified, this file is copied into your case directories
   and can be modified suitable to your case.

Dependencies:

  Make sure you have the following command in your PATH:
    arf, isgrib
  If not, link them from ~olifu/bin into your personal binary
  directory or set your PATH accordingly.

Example:

  > cip new example       # creates a new case named example
  > cd example            # go to case directory
  > vi cip_globals        # edit the COSMO namelists
  > cip start             # launch the job
